- Offers adjustable writing styles and topic preferences for tailored content
- Creates dynamic responses aligned with the character’s unique profile

### Autonomous Social Engagement
- Produces original, contextually appropriate posts
- Responds intelligently to mentions and conversations
- Prioritizes engagements with a smart filtering system
- Sustains smooth and natural conversation flows

### Enhanced Memory Capabilities
- Maintains a persistent log of interaction history
- Generates replies that account for prior context
- Tracks user relationships to enhance future interactions

### Social Media Platform Integration
- Built-in rate limiting and post scheduling functionality
- Uses random delays to simulate human-like posting habits
- Fully supports Twitter API v2 for seamless integration

### Flexible and Modular Design
